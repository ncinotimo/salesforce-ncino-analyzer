    <description>
      nCino is a financial services platform built on Salesforce. Key concepts:
      - LLC_BI__ prefix indicates nCino managed package components
      - nc_ prefix indicates custom project-specific fields
      - Loan objects (LLC_BI__Loan__c) are central to the data model

  <analysis_request>
    Please analyze these fields against our naming conventions and identify violations.
    
    For each field that violates our conventions, provide:
    1. The field API name
    2. The specific convention violated
    3. A recommended fix
    
    Then, provide an overall compliance score as a percentage of fields that follow conventions.
    Group violations by severity:
    - Critical: Non-compliant custom field naming patterns that could cause conflicts
    - Medium: Fields that don't follow project's naming standards
    - Low: Minor formatting issues
    
    Finally, provide recommendations for improving naming convention adoption.
